# SimpleJSON
SimpleJSON is a header-only C++ library for parsing and creating JSON objects without dependecies on any libraries besides the C++ standard library. <br>
Main features of the library are parsing, manipulating and dumping JSON objects to/from streams. <br>
JSON objects are represented with class `simpleJSON::JSONObject` and manipulating them is easy and almost JavaScript-like.

Requires C++17
